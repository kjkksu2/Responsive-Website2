        Seoul was the capital of various Korean states, including Baekje,
        Joseon, the Korean Empire, Goryeo, and presently South Korea.
        Strategically located along the Han River, Seoul's history stretches
        back over two thousand years, when it was founded in 18 BC by the people
        of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. The city was later
        designated the capital of Korea under the Joseon dynasty. Seoul is
        surrounded by a mountainous and hilly landscape, with Bukhan Mountain
        located on the northern edge of the city. The Seoul Capital Area
        contains five UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Changdeok Palace, Hwaseong
        Fortress, Jogmyo Shrine, Namhansanseong and the Royal Tombs of the
        Joseon Dynasty.
